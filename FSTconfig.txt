### Example for Counters Strike with counterstrafing
# -----------------------------
# Counter Strike focus group - everything following <focus> will activate when an active
# window matches the name or has the part of the name in itself that is given after <focus>

# Macros
# automatic counter strafing when w key released
# will not trigger if crouched (!ctrl) or opposite key is pressed (!s for forward)
# (tr("+w")>100): will only trigger if movement key was pressed for at least 100 ms
# (last("-space")>500): will only trigger if time since last press of space is longer than 500 ms
# (cs("+w")): counterstrafe will be dynamically adjusted based on time of pressed movement key 
# cs() is a hard coded function that uses a polynomial function to approximate the acceleration
#    ingame and calculate the needed length for a counterstrafe to come to a stop
