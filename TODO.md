# TODO — maintainer's open items

Numbering: every entry ID is UNIQUE and NEVER REUSED — used so far up to #36, new
entries start at #37 (closed IDs stay reserved in `todo_records.md`).
Closed entries live in `todo_records.md` (one-line records — resolution in file/git log).
Entries follow the AGENTS.md contract (title / evidence / outcome / acceptance / scope / status).

## Maintainer calls (open, in order)

1. **v1.3 log-growth confirmation** — the ONE measurement the standing no-`plugin.log`
   constraint defers: ONE scoped, one-shot read of the retained log's post-base segment
   (expect the three now-silent types at 0 + ≈79 % event-line cut). Default: SKIP unless
   requested → #17 (NAP MAINTAINER CALL 1).
2. **#11 contradiction prevention** — held on the maintainer's LIVE test: the `XXX 241016-1101`
   pin at `fst_keyboard.py` ≈791 is his find-marker — do not touch → #11.
3. **v2.5 nudge target scope — RESOLVED 2026-09-10 (maintainer ruling):** the readout must
   reach EVERY acting session — blind spots unacceptable for an action (the #18
   most-recently-updated-session caveat stays acceptable for reminder text only); read
   mechanic (session id in the readout vs per-session readout) = build worker's call under
   that invariant → #33.
4. **Deferred FST behavior batch** (post-plugin; present ≤3 per message): #1 vk-error
   surfacing, #7 empty-macro comment vs behavior, #8 ap/ar semantics, #9 except-harden,
   #4 + #6 dead-code deletion.
5. Schedule (DECIDED — not open calls): #33 v2.5 build is NOT a maintainer call — APPROVED,
   next build; #30 de-peek APPROVED — ONE cycle (node:sqlite gauge landing + peek.py removal
   + doc purge + v1.3 log-profile re-baseline), scheduled AFTER #33.

## FST behavior decisions (open — maintainer calls unless noted)

## 1. General vk resolution: unknown keys must surface to the user (tabled 2026-09-06)

- **Problem / evidence:** wherever a key string resolves to a vk_code (`convert_to_vk_code`
  + all its call sites) it should raise AND be communicated to the user — important
  feedback; today many paths fail silently or only print to console. State-shorthand
  constraints now fail-closed on unknown keys (2026-09-06, `fst_manager.py`
  `constraint_evaluation`) but still only print — fold into the general solution.
- **Outcome (goal):** ONE general solution covering every vk-resolution site (not
  per-call-site fixes) with the user-visible error; the constraint path reuses it.
- **Acceptance:** unknown key ⇒ user-visible error at every resolution site (never
  console-only); the constraint fail-closed path emits the same user-visible error; suite
  green.
- **Scope (non-exhaustive):** `convert_to_vk_code` + all its call sites (`fst_manager.py`,
  `fst_keyboard.py`, …); `constraint_evaluation`'s unknown-key branch.
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (section above, item 4). Unknown constraint *names*
  stay silent no-ops by design (`SPEC_FEATURES.md` §4 #2) — out of scope.

## 7. Empty macro: comment/behavior mismatch at `fst_keyboard.py` 707 (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** the comment says an empty key group does "not supress the
  triggerkey", but `alias_fired = True` (line 697) is set BEFORE the empty check — so the
  trigger IS suppressed (`_listener.suppress_event`, verified by
  `test_empty_macro_sequence_no_playback`). Comment and behavior cannot both be right.
- **Outcome (goal):** comment and behavior agree — decide which is right, reword or fix
  accordingly.
- **Acceptance:** the 707 comment matches the (possibly new) behavior; a test pins the
  chosen semantics; suite green.
- **Scope:** `fst_keyboard.py` empty-macro check (≈697/707); the pinning test in `tests/`.
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (item 4 above).

## 8. `ap`/`ar` "all keys (incl simulated)" is not a union — last-write-wins shared dict (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** `ap(...)` documents "press of all keys (incl simulated)"
  (`fst_manager.py` 253–256), but `set_real_key_press_state` (1611–1614) and
  `set_simulated_key_press_state` (1622–1625) both write the shared
  `_all_key_press_states_dict` last-write-wins — a release from either side clears `all`
  even while the other press is still active, so `ap` may not behave as "real OR
  simulated". Asymmetric: the real-setter lacks the `vk_code > 0` guard the other two
  setters have. Found in the interrupted Phase-5 run (it explains the 1630–1632 KeyError
  coverage gap).
- **Outcome (goal):** confirm the intended `ap`/`ar` semantics (or fix the dict handling +
  the missing guard) and pin the chosen behavior with a test.
- **Acceptance:** documented semantics; crossing press/release on either side behaves per
  the confirmed semantics (the other side's `all` state preserved under a union); the
  guard symmetric if the union is confirmed; suite green.
- **Scope:** `Input_State_Manager` state setters (≈1611–1632); `ap(...)` docs (253–256).
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (item 4 above).

## 9. Repeat-constraint excepts too narrow for malformed `repeat_thread_dict` entries (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** `toggle_repeat` (327), `is_repeat_active` (340), `reset_repeat`
  (350) catch `(KeyError, AttributeError)`; `stop_all_repeat` (365) only `AttributeError` —
  but unpacking an entry that is not a 2-tuple raises `ValueError`, uncaught, propagating
  out of `constraint_evaluation`. Low severity: entries are only written as 2-tuples
  `[task, handle]` by `start_repeat` (301).
- **Outcome (goal):** decide harden the excepts or leave as-is — record the decision.
- **Acceptance:** decision recorded here; if harden: `ValueError` covered in the four
  methods + a test; suite green.
- **Scope:** `fst_manager.py` ≈301–365 (`Input_State_Manager` repeat methods).
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (item 4 above).

## 4. Dead code: `fst_manager.py` 116–117 ("None result → pass") unreachable (2026-09-07/08)

- **Problem / evidence:** `check_constraint_fulfillment`'s "None → pass" branch (line 117)
  can never run — `constraint_evaluation` normalizes `None` → `True` (≈691) before
  returning, and no other branch returns `None`; line 117 stays uncovered in every run and
  the triage's 2098/2217 (94.6 %) ceiling is really 2097/2217 (same rounded number).
  Recorded at discovery (`2007698` commit msg). Absorbs the 260908-0951 dedup-block item 1.
- **Outcome (goal):** the dead branch is deleted — the A→C triage reclassification is the
  maintainer's call (`COVERAGE_TRIAGE.md` is agent-read-only).
- **Acceptance:** 116–117 removed (or the triage plan reclassified by the maintainer);
  suite green; coverage expectations updated.
- **Scope:** `fst_manager.py` ≈107–125; the triage plan (maintainer-side only).
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (item 4 above, batched with #6).

## 6. Dead code: `fst_keyboard.py` 302–303 (mixed-Key rebind conversion) unreachable (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** in `initialize_groups_from_presorted_lines`, `convert_key_string_group`
  only ever appends `Key_Event`s (bare keys expand to press/release events), so
  `new_trigger_group[0]` is never a `Key`; the 295-block is entered only via a `Key`
  replacement — which makes line 301 `False`, so 302–303 (`replacement_key = Key(...)`)
  can never execute. Proven at `fffea8b` (rebinds `w : e` and `w : +e` both leave 302–303
  uncovered). Triage classed them A — same misclassification as #4. Also: the triage's
  numeric example `"8" → 8` is wrong — `"8"` resolves via the dict to 56; the numeric
  branch needs a string absent from `vk_codes_dict` (e.g. `"255"`). Absorbs the 260908-0951
  dedup-block item 4 (first half).
- **Outcome (goal):** the dead block is deleted (or kept on an explicit maintainer
  decision — the triage class correction rides with #4).
- **Acceptance:** 302–303 removed; suite green; coverage expectations updated.
- **Scope:** `fst_keyboard.py` ≈295–305.
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (item 4 above, batched with #4).

## 11. General contradiction prevention disabled (`XXX 241016-1101`, `fst_keyboard.py` 791) — HOLDING (2026-09-08)

`###XXX 241016-1101 general contradiction prevention disabled to test` — the 793–803
contradiction block of `_win32_event_filter` no longer suppresses (`to_be_suppressed` is
not set), and the Phase-5 tests (`tests/test_filter_simulated.py`) now pin that
non-suppression. Clarify + document as final decision: if it stays off, reword the
XXX/"to test" comment so it reads as an intentional decision; if it was meant to be
reenabled, that is the call.

- **Status:** HOLDING — the maintainer's LIVE test decides (DECISION); the
  `XXX 241016-1101` pin at ≈791 is HIS find-marker — do not remove or reword it on his
  behalf. Content verbatim from the 2026-09-08 record.

## Docs & misc (open)

## 3. Rework README and WIKI to the current state of the code (2026-09-06)

- **Problem / evidence:** full gap matrix + decisions made 2026-09-06 in
  `SPEC_FEATURES.md` sections 2–4. Known doc fixes: WIKI "played in its own thread" →
  asyncio tasks (§4 #5); `|(name)` per-type semantics (§4 #6); `dc()` sign has no effect
  (§4 #9); README/WIKI V1.1.3 → V1.2.0 references; "Python 3.6" vs 3.12 venv; typos
  (§4 #12); replacement-side key reinterpretation in Key rebinds + quoted key strings
  inside `p(...)` (§4 #14); eaten-rebind suppression semantics + `a|(p("shift")) : b`
  pass-through pattern (§4 #14).
- **Outcome (goal):** README + WIKI state of record match the code — the §4 gap items
  closed one by one.
- **Acceptance:** every §4 gap item fixed or explicitly decided-and-annotated; docs-only
  diff; suite unaffected.
- **Scope:** `README.md`, the WIKI pages, `SPEC_FEATURES.md` (source of the decisions).
- **Status:** OPEN — default-approved docs work (NOT a maintainer call — just gets done).

## Plugin & gauge (open)

## 17. v1.3 log-growth CONFIRMATION — one-shot read, deferred by the no-`plugin.log` constraint (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** the old-profile measurement (v1.1+v2 era): the delegation cycle
  grew the log to 1036 lines / 571 KB in 5 min (≈0.9 KB/s — the "rapid growth" complaint,
  quantified); child-session lines ≈47 % of total; the residual unsilenced types were
  `file.watcher.updated` ×41, `file.edited` ×7, `session.idle` ×1. v1.3 = silence exactly
  those — landed 2026-09-09 (#29 item 3) — but the live byte-ratio of that extension has
  NOT been measured; measuring requires a read of `plugin.log`, which the standing
  maintainer constraint forbids except ONE scoped, one-shot read on request.
- **Outcome (goal):** take the v1.3 profile — ONE scoped, one-shot read of the retained
  log's post-base segment; expect the three types at 0 + ≈79 % event-line cut; refresh the
  NAP's log base (currently 1269 — STALE on purpose).
- **Acceptance:** measured ratio + new log base recorded in the NAP; this entry closes.
- **Status:** OPEN — MAINTAINER CALL (section above, item 1; default: SKIP unless asked —
  never parse the log unprompted).

## 30. De-peek: replace the peek.py shell-out with an in-plugin `node:sqlite` read (2026-09-09)

- **Problem / evidence:** the gauge shell-outs (`$`-tagged-template → `.venv/Scripts/python.exe
  .opencode/ctxgauge/peek.py`, `handover.ts` ≈301) against the OLD opencode.db schema —
  fragile (fresh-session `fetchone() → None` class of bug, #21/#24). `node:sqlite` is
  built into the probe node v24.19.0 (confirm exposed on the system CLI host — it was
  absent in the electron host).
- **Outcome (goal — ONE cycle, APPROVED):** (1) in-plugin `node:sqlite` gauge landing +
  peek.py removal (`.opencode/ctxgauge/` delete, unless the maintainer keeps a
  standalone-CLI copy — his call) + doc purge (`AGENTS.md` COPY — the original is
  agent-read-only — + `prompt_agent_planner.md` + `prompt_agent_task.md`); (2) re-baseline
  the v1.3 log-profile measurement in the SAME cycle (landing de-peek re-baselines the
  gauge host — the probe's S4 fake-shell gauge shapes must be rebuilt per the #20
  exception); (3) the read is written against the CURRENT opencode.db schema (`session` /
  message-token JSON; model id from `session.model`'s `id`) and guards the fresh-session
  case like peek.py does (no finished message ⇒ `CTX=0`, never throw into the transform) —
  this replaces the parked #21 v2-schema note.
- **Carry-over caveat (UNVERIFIED, from the 2026-09-09 dirty `peek.py` diff, committed with
  that entry):** "should total not be the most current total token number? output should
  be the generated tokens for the last message so it should be substract output from
  total" — i.e. `total − output` may already be the right readout — CHECK the token-field
  meaning BEFORE wiring the same arithmetic into handover.ts; record the verified meaning
  when done.
- **Acceptance:** no python shell-out on the gauge path; probe passes (rebuilt S4); the
  doc references purged (AGENTS.md via the hand-over copy); token semantics recorded here.
- **Scope:** `.opencode/plugin/handover_v2.4.ts` (readout ≈301), `.opencode/ctxgauge/`,
  `prompt_agent_planner.md`, `prompt_agent_task.md`, the AGENTS.md copy.
- **Token semantics — VERIFIED (record per this cycle's task fact 3, closes the
  carry-over caveat above):** `total = input + output + cache.read` holds EXACTLY across all
  recent step rows → `ctx = total − output` = the exact prompt size at the latest finished
  step = current context at that moment (measured 2026-09-10; the implemented read-out is built on this).
- **Backend ruling (2026-09-09, maintainer):** the node:sqlite design is SUPERSEDED — the
  plugin host (opencode.exe, a bun-compiled binary) cannot be trusted with node:sqlite (the
  T1 worker could not solve a sqlite call via node modules there). The core now spawns the
  maintainer-placed `.opencode/plugin/tools/sqlite3.exe` (args array, `file:…?mode=ro`,
  marker SQL `M|…`/`S|…`, no PRAGMA in the call — its echo pollutes stdout). Verified live
  under node v24.19.0 + bun 1.4.2; the worker's digit corruption (multiplier `105` →
  `100`/`1000`) fixed; window rule = trailing `<N>K` × 1000 exactly, last marker wins
  (maintainer-confirmed).
- **Backend RE-RULING (2026-09-10, maintainer):** the sqlite3.exe spawn backend is
  SUPERSEDED — back to built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`; node v24.19.0 flag-free per
  fact 1 of the task spec). Rationale: the 3bit Q3 workers lost coherence on the SQL/JSON
  detail work; the build now runs on the 4bit same-model worker `worker_Q4_120K`
  (maintainer restart with the new roster). The bun-compiled opencode.exe host risk is
  guarded by the never-throw `db-error` fallback; the worker records a bun 1.4.2 host-proxy
  check; production evidence = maintainer restart + one-shot log read (call 1).
  `sqlite3.exe` stays on disk (maintainer-placed, now unused — do not delete).
- **Status:** LANDING (2026-09-10, continuation 2 — node:sqlite re-ruling) —
  plugin wiring + probe + node:sqlite core landed this cycle — log-profile
  re-baseline pending maintainer restart + one-shot log read (call 1, default
  SKIP). bun 1.4.2 host-proxy check: PASS (core import + `readGauge()` green
  under system bun, kind=ok on the live db). The build scope is complete (core
  node:sqlite-only, v2.5 plugin wiring + probe 33/33, peek.py deleted); do NOT
  close — the log-profile tail + #34 residual doc refs remain open.

## 33. v2.5 auto-nudge ladder build (folded in: the former TOP-of-file note) — STATUS: APPROVED — NEXT BUILD

- **Problem / evidence:** the chat.message ctx line only covers USER messages — an
  unsupervised agent gets no mid-run context signal and walks blindly into its limit
  (self-peek is the only mid-run signal today). The former top-of-file note (2026-09-10)
  added: at <5k REM the agent is nudged with the VERBATIM self-gauge
  `CTX=… REM=… — stop-line reached` (working past the line is a rule violation — the
  planner decides continuation) → the FINAL 5 k rung of the ladder.
- **Outcome (goal — approved design):** a per-session nudge ladder fired from
  `tool.execute.after` (the plugin is agent-independent — ALL agents, planner + workers),
  rungs **50 % (generic) → 70 % / REM ≤30k → 80 % / ≤20k (wind-down — just before the 85 %
  line) → 90 % / ≤10k (critical — commit + write the NAP NOW)** — condition = pct OR REM,
  whichever first, ≤1 nudge per rung per session — PLUS the final 5 k rung above,
  requesting further approval. Delivered via `client.session.promptAsync(...)` synthetic
  text part (fire-and-forget; queues as the next turn at idle; the TUI never renders it
  as the maintainer's message). Evidence: `kind:"nudge"` log lines — SILENT otherwise
  (the v1.x skip-set log-growth discipline applies). The chat.message ctx line STAYS.
- **Target-scope pre-build call — RESOLVED 2026-09-10 (maintainer ruling):** the readout
  must reach EVERY acting session (blind spot unacceptable for an action — the #18
  most-recently-updated-session caveat stays acceptable for reminder text only); the read
  mechanic (session id carried in the readout vs a per-session read) is the build worker's
  call under that invariant.
- **Full design:** NAP `## v2.4.1 LIVE + v2.5 NUDGE LADDER spec` + `## Live status` blocks
  (09-10); #32 holds the root-cause record.
- **Acceptance:** the ladder fires per rung (probe: extend the bun probe — fake client +
  fake shell); one maintainer restart + a forced high-readout scenario shows the first
  nudge land; no NEW gauge-failure reasons (the silent path stays silent);
  `kind:"nudge"` evidence lines only.
- **Status:** APPROVED — NEXT BUILD (not a maintainer call — all pre-build calls resolved).
- **Read-mechanic half (built by T1): NOT landed (2026-09-10)** — T1 stopped at the context
  stop-line (#35): the session-gated readout is designed, and its read form + the honest
  unknown-window / notAvailable forms + `SESSION=<sid>` carry landed in the committed shared
  core (`ctxgauge/gauge.mjs`); the PLUGIN wiring (v2.5 match-only post) is NOT landed — the
  live plugin is unchanged (its old shell readout now points at the deleted peek file → a
  restart before v2.5 lands yields kind:gauge no-ctx-output failure lines — no ctx: line for
  agents, never a throw). The ladder
  (T2) remains pending as scheduled — it now also waits on the #30-core plugin wiring.
  - **Discrepancy (2026-09-09, shell-doc lab):** self-peek `node .opencode\ctxgauge\peek.mjs`
    reports the wrong window — `CTX=58271 (582%) REM=-47771` on this 120k-window session
    (window read ≈10.5k; pct/REM both nonsense, negative REM). The plugin's `chat.message`
    ctx line computed the SAME session correctly at the same time (`CTX=24187 (20%) REM=95813`
    ⇒ 120k window). Shared gauge core / peek window read needs a fix before self-peek
    numbers are trusted; the true readout here was ≈`CTX=58271 (~49%) REM≈62k`.

## Closed entries

Moved to `todo_records.md` on 2026-09-10 — one-line records, IDs 2, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32 (+ the 260908-0951 dedup block).
All those IDs stay reserved — see the numbering rule in the header.

## 34. Stale `peek.py` documentation refs + worker prompt permission block (2026-09-10, build T1)

- **Problem / evidence:** peek.py was deleted in the T1 cycle, but documentation/permissions leave no usable single line: `agents_repo.md` line ~139 ("Context gauge: run `& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .opencode\ctxgauge\peek.py`" + module map line ~97) is maintainer-owned; the root `AGENTS.md` is per its own rule + opencode.jsonc read-only for workers (denies `AGENTS.md`); `.opencode/prompt_agent_planner.md` + `prompt_agent_task.md` — the self-peek line there still points to `agents_repo.md` (old python command) — and the opencode.jsonc worker permission denies `.opencode/prompt_**`, so the T1 pre-approved self-peek edit could NOT be made by the worker; remaining non-doc references also found but unchanged: `playground/outline_rework_prompts.md` (four peek refs in maintainer-rework draft), `SCRATCH_PAD.md` (WIP note), `deactivated/handover.ts` (frozen dead copy — removal is maintainer call), `handover_planner.md` (planner-owned).
- **Outcome (goal):** a single self-peek line `node .opencode\ctxgauge\peek.mjs` (readout `SESSION=… CTX=… (…) REM=…`) in the four maintainer-side agent documents (`prompt_agent_planner.md`, `prompt_agent_task.md`, `agents_repo.md`, root `AGENTS.md`); maintainer decides fate of the residual references listed above (update or leave as historical).
- **Acceptance:** no live agent-facing doc references peek.py; prompt self-peek line = node CLI (the wording of the `ctx:` nudge description keeps mentioning the `SESSION=…` prefix); the residual list is either updated or explicitly left.
- **Scope:** the files named above.
- **Status:** prompt-file self-peek lines DONE (planner execution, 2026-09-10 bookkeeping
  commit — `prompt_agent_planner.md` + `prompt_agent_task.md` now self-peek via
  `node .opencode\ctxgauge\peek.mjs` with the `SESSION=…` wording; the worker was blocked
  by the `.opencode/prompt_**` deny). REMAINING = maintainer call: the `agents_repo.md`
  gauge line (~164) + module-map line (~97) (maintainer-owned), and the residual refs
  (frozen `deactivated/handover.ts` copy, `playground/outline_rework_prompts.md` draft,
  historical files — recommendation: update the agents_repo.md line, leave the rest
  historical).

## 35. T1 de-peek build IN PROGRESS — read mechanic not landed; continue on a bigger window (2026-09-10)

- **Problem / evidence:** T1 build (task file `.opencode/handover_task.md`) stopped at the
  context stop-line: self-gauge read at stop time `CTX=106441 (87%)` (≈14 k left vs. ≈45–50 k
  estimated for the remainder). Landed + committed: shared gauge core (`ctxgauge/gauge.mjs`)
  + self-peek CLI (`ctxgauge/peek.mjs`, verified live against the real DB) + peek.py
  deletion + suite 434/434. NOT landed (spec DoD pending): the v2.5 plugin wiring in
  `handover_v2.4.ts` (native gauge import + session-gated match-only post + `sess` evidence
  field + db-error vocabulary + header block + dead shell mechanism deletion), the probe
  rebuild (currently pointing at the deleted `handover.ts` — stale; S4/S6 shapes per spec),
  the doc purge (#34), the v1.3 log-profile rebaseline (call 1, default SKIP).
- **Outcome (goal):** T1 completed per spec (probe `PROBE handover: N/N PASS`, suite 434/434,
  `peek.mjs` prints the `SESSION=…` line — this one already holds — plugin lands the gated read, #30/#33 tail updates, commit).
- **Acceptance:** task file DoD items 1–5 all true.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/handover_v2.4.ts`, `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`, doc files in #34, `TODO.md`.
- **Status:** OPEN — the T1 build scope itself is COMPLETE (2026-09-10, continuation 2 —
  see the status tail below); remaining tail = the v1.3 log-profile re-baseline + #34
  residual doc refs. 2026-09-09 update:
  the sqlite-via-node:sqlite problem is SOLVED per maintainer ruling — the core
  (`ctxgauge/gauge.mjs` + `peek.mjs`) landed on the sqlite3.exe backend (planner-direct,
  verified live, corruption fixed; task file now carries a PLANNER RULING block). Remaining
  continuation scope: plugin wiring (session-gated match-only post) + probe rebuild +
  suite/ruff + peek.py deletion + #30/#35 status lines — per the ruling block + DoD.
  2026-09-10: backend RE-RULING (node:sqlite, see #30) — the committed core's sqlite3.exe
  read mechanic is re-implemented in continuation 2; the 3bit 210K delegation looped
  (no partial commits, verified via git log); re-delegated to `worker_Q4_120K`.
  **2026-09-10 (continuation 2 — LANDED):** node:sqlite core + v2.5 plugin wiring +
  probe rebuild (33/33) + suite 434/434 + ruff F=0 + peek.py deletion committed;
  remaining tail = the v1.3 log-profile re-baseline (maintainer call 1) + #34
  residual doc refs (planner/maintainer-owned).

## 36. (closed 2026-09-09) `agents_repo.md` `Environment & shell` — wrong/stale lines (lab-verified, fixed)

One-line record: the section (previously 48 lines) was validated in fresh-worker
first-shot batteries (T1–T10, pwsh + git-bash) and compacted 48→24 lines; round 2
ended 10/10 first-shot. Corrected/verified facts now in the section: `ConvertTo-Path`
does NOT exist in pwsh 7.6 (the old text suggested it — guaranteed first-shot failure);
`$env:NO_COLOR='1'` does NOT suppress ANSI codes in table output; env var `FST` value
carries a trailing `\`; bare `python` on PATH = 3.14.3 without repo deps (fake-starts,
then import-fails — always venv exe); scalar listing recipe needs `-File`; `pwd -W`
prints forward slashes. Status: closed — section committed as tested.
