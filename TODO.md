# TODO — maintainer's open items

## 1. General vk resolution: unknown keys must surface to the user (tabled 2026-09-06)

Wherever a key string is resolved to a vk_code (`convert_to_vk_code` and all its call
sites), an unknown key should raise an error and be **directly communicated to the
user** — it is important feedback, and many paths today fail silently or only print
to console. Needs a **general** solution covering every vk-resolution site, not
per-call-site fixes.

Related: state-shorthand constraints now fail-closed on unknown keys (2026-09-06,
`fst_manager.py` `constraint_evaluation`) but still only print — fold into the general
solution. Unknown constraint *names* are silent no-ops by design (see
`SPEC_FEATURES.md` §4 #2 decision).

## 2. Rework README and WIKI to the current state of the code (2026-09-06)

Full gap matrix + decisions made 2026-09-06 in `SPEC_FEATURES.md` sections 2–4.
Known doc fixes include: WIKI "played in its own thread" → asyncio tasks (§4 #5),
`|(name)` per-type semantics (§4 #6), `dc()` sign has no effect (§4 #9), README/WIKI
V1.1.3 → V1.2.0 references, "Python 3.6" vs 3.12 venv, typos (§4 #12).
