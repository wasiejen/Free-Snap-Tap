## COMPRESSED 2026-09-15 (Part-2 cleanup, ses_f5d9e86a6) — verbatim section text (no-loss rule)

## 2026-09-10 (looprun 2, iteration 4) — P09+P07 applied to the LIVE looprunner prompt + #47 CLOSED
- **Start state:** dirty tree = `opencode.jsonc` (maintainer's live P01 edit,
  uncommitted BY DESIGN — never stage/flag it) + `.opencode/prompt_looprunner.md`
  (the looprunner had APPENDED the P09/P07 suggestion block below its divider,
  uncommitted). No interrupted planner/worker work otherwise.
- **Maintainer launch message = the XXX note itself** ("make autonom an option
  instead of stating it as an always-true fact") = approved P09. Applied AHEAD
  of his copy-on-restart (identical content — his later copy is a no-op): the
  live `prompt_looprunner.md` now carries the approved replacement (autonom
  stated conditionally on the `<|autonom|>` marker, XXX note deleted, P07
  iteration-number line added). Commit `c4ad33c`. The looprunner's uncommitted
  append was superseded (the text lives in `proposals/files/prompt_looprunner.md`
  + the git diff history). Note for the next planner: the new embedded planner
  text no longer routes the XXX line into launches.
- **#47 CLOSED (planner-direct; both residuals = settled answers, no re-check):**
  WIKI [Variable system] + shared text/integer name-space line (`is_set` True for
  a stored text — a text is never equal to 0); WIKI [Mouse keys] + horizontal
  scroll direction line (press = one notch RIGHT, release = LEFT). Gate: 436
  passed, 1 known warning; ruff F=0. One-line record in `todo_records.md`.
- **P02 SPEC committed** in `handover_task.md` (delegation-ready, self-contained:
  scope + DoD incl. probe-count arithmetic + the "your commit = last write to the
  summary file" rule). Launch is iteration 5 item 1 — FIRST try `worker_Q4_120K`
  (the P01 re-test: worker-prompt launches should survive now that `limit.context`
  is declared); raw `agent_Q4_120K` + compact protocol as fallback.
- NO FST code touched; baseline intact (436 / ruff 0).
- **NEXT (iteration 5, in order):**
  1. LAUNCH P02 per the committed spec, then VERIFY (probe N/N exit 0 + the
     mirror check gone by grep + gate 436/ruff 0 + `git diff` scope = plugin +
     probe + summary + functional proof: `handover_task_to_planner.md` NOT
     modified after the worker's commit — the first clean run closes the P02
     collision saga; restore via `git checkout --` if it still happens). Move
     P02 → `proposals/implemented/` with a verdict note.
  2. **P08** (#44 ConfigError, approved incl. degrade-to-defaults): the spec
     needs FRESH code reads of the raise/catch sites (`fst_keyboard.py:386/1021`,
     `convert_to_vk_code`, `check_for_combination`, CLI menu, GUI toggle handlers,
     hot-path wrap) — write it, then delegate (worker_Q4_120K; the design is the
     approved `proposals/approved/P08_configerror-design.md`).
  3. Draft the **1346 proposal** (NAP bloat / prompt separation of concern) into
     `.opencode/proposals/` (the request sits in
     `proposals/maintainer/inbox_planner/M260910-1346_nap-bloat-prompt-separation.md`
     — move it to `maintainer/done/` after drafting).
  4. Maintainer calls bundle (≤3) in the closing message.
- **Maintainer calls (standing, bundle ≤3):** (1) the FST behavior batch
  (#1/#7/#8/#9/#4+#6 — semantics decisions); (2) headless-toast hardening:
  headless toast invocations (`show_message`/`show_timer`/`remove_toast`/
  `remove_all_toasts`) raise TypeError (callbacks None outside GUI — the #47
  flag 1) — harden to a printed no-op vs. keep "requires GUI" docs-as-is;
  (3) #17 v1.3 log-profile rebaseline (call 1, default SKIP).
