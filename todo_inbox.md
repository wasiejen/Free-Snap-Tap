# todo_inbox.md — raw findings inbox

Drop zone for **worker** / **explorer** findings that are not confidently
fixable in-scope or are out of scope. Loose format: dated, role-tagged blocks,
**no numbering**, append only — no curation, no renumbering here.

- **Who writes:** worker/explorer — this is their APPEND target, NOT `TODO.md`.
- **Who curates:** the planner — curates into `TODO.md`, assigns the stable ID
  at curation time, then trims this inbox.
- Entry shape: `## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <role>` + problem/evidence + files + why it
  matters.

## 2026-09-15 — planner curation (plan3)
- Trimmed all prior blocks (2026-09-10..2026-09-15): the 09-10/09-11/09-12
  blocks were already curated when they landed (records in the NAP history +
  this file's prior state in git log).
- Worker-10 (09-12) block_transfer MOVE/`dstFile` block-loss finding →
  `TODO.md` **#57**.
- Script-collection worker (09-15): branch-name mismatch in the launch
  message → handled (planner prompt "Branch truth" bullet, plan3; the loop
  branches were re-aligned, `opencode_test` fast-forwarded to the loop HEAD);
  stale corpus → one-off `--all --slim` refresh executed (plan3) + cadence
  decision → `TODO.md` **#59**; missing probe command in the gate definition
  → `TODO.md` **#58**.
